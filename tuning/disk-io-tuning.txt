------------- Tuning the Disk I/O Subsystem Performance --------------------

The access speeds of the CPU cache, memory, and disks vary greatly. 
If the data required for CPU computing is not loaded to the memory or cache in a timely manner,
the CPU spends a lot of time waiting for the drive to read. 

  --------------- Common Performance Monitoring Tools ---------------------
  1. iostat
    installation: # yum -y install sysstat
    usage: # iostat -d -k -x 1 100

  2. blktrace: blktrace is a user-mode tool that provides detailed information about time consumption on the I/O subsystem.
     You can analyze whether the I/O scheduling is slow or the hardware response is slow based on the information.
    installation: # yum -y install blktrace
      usage:
        1. Run the blktrace command to capture the I/O information of a specified device
            # blktrace -w 120 -d /dev/sda
        2. Run the blkparse command to parse the data generated by blktrace.
            # blkparse -i vda.blktrace.* -d blkparse.out
        3. Run the btt command to view the overall I/O status.
            #  btt -i blkparse.out


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q2Q: time interval for sending multiple requests to the block I/O layer.
Q2G: time consumed by I/O request generation, including time for remapping (the I/O request may be remapped to other devices by Device Mapper or Multiple Device (Software RAID)) and time for splitting (the I/O request may be split into multiple physical I/Os because the I/O request is not aligned with the sector boundary or the size of the I/O request is too large).
G2I: time consumed by an I/O request to enter the I/O scheduler, including the time for merging (I/O requests may be merged into one I/O requet because they are physically adjacent to each other).
I2D: waiting time of an I/O request in the I/O scheduler.
D2C: time consumed by I/O requests on the driver and hardware (I/O requests are submitted by the driver to the hardware, pass through the HBA, cables (such as optical fibers and network cables), switch (SAN or network), and finally arrive at the storage device. The device returns the result after completing the I/O requests).
Q2C: time consumed by the entire I/O request (Q2I + I2D + D2C = Q2C), which is equivalent to the await value of iostat.
In normal cases, the D2C proportion is greater than 90%. If the I2D proportion is high, you can adjust the I/O scheduling policy.
